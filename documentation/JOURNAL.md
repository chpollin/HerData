## 2025-10-19

**Session 1 - Data Verification & Initial Documentation**
- Fixed script paths, executed CMIF analysis (15,312 letters verified)
- Counted SNDB entities: 23,571 persons (3,617 women/15.3%), 4,007 places, 6,580 relationships, 29,375 occupations
- Discovered correct field name: SEXUS (not GESCHLECHT)
- Corrected GND coverage: 53.4% SNDB, 93.8% CMIF senders
- Created complete documentation: data.md, project.md, research-context.md, TODO-Dokumentation.md
- Initial commit (dbef54b): 22 files pushed to GitHub
- Refactored TODO to neutral reporting style
- Created JOURNAL.md, refactored to compact format
- Created design.md with full UI/UX specification

**Session 2 - Project Overview & Repository Setup**
- Analyzed full project structure (knowledge docs, data files, preprocessing script)
- Created comprehensive README.md with complete file structure, data sources, statistics
- Set up docs/ folder for future GitHub Pages implementation (placeholder README only)
- Created requirements.md with 14 user stories (5 epics), 10 functional requirements, 3 implementation phases
- Refactored JOURNAL.md to compact format (date-based, aggregated sessions)
- Created IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with 7-day detailed breakdown for Phase 1 MVP
- Created CLAUDE.md with documentation and code style guidelines (no bold, no emojis, no time estimates)

**Key Decisions:**
- Use SEXUS field for gender identification
- Document only verified data (no estimates)
- Add absolute numbers alongside all percentages
- TODO file is descriptive reference (non-binding)
- Script paths relative to project root
- Exclude .claude/ from version control

**Session 3 - Data Pipeline Implementation**
- Analyzed complete project structure: 95% documentation complete, data ready, code at 5%
- Merged and updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with comprehensive 7-day sprint, actual results, code examples
- Implemented build_herdata.py with 4-phase pipeline architecture
- Fixed XML field names: SEXUS (gender), ART+JAHR (dates), SNDB_ID (place links), BEZEICHNUNG (place names), LATITUDE/LONGITUDE (coordinates)
- Pipeline execution: 1.39 seconds total runtime
- Phase 1: Extracted 3,617 women (SEXUS='w'), 34.1% GND coverage, 83.9% with dates
- Phase 2: Matched 808 women to CMIF (192 senders, 772 mentioned via GND-ID + name fallback)
- Phase 3: Enriched 1,042 women with geodata (28.8%), 979 with occupations
- Phase 4: Generated docs/data/persons.json (1.49 MB, 3,617 entries)
- Implemented compact testing strategy: inline validation with assertions at each phase
- Fixed Windows console encoding (replaced Unicode checkmarks with [OK])

**Key Findings:**
- Women have lower GND coverage than overall SNDB (34.1% vs 53.4%)
- CMIF matching rate: 22.3% of women found in letters (808/3,617)
- Geodata coverage for women: 28.8% (lower than expected 60%, realistic)
- Occupation data available for 27% of women (979/3,617)
- JSON output optimized: removed null fields, 1.49 MB total
- Ancient historical figures present (9 persons <1000 CE: Cleopatra, Livia, etc.)

**Testing Implementation:**
- Created build_herdata_test.py with comprehensive test suite
- 48 tests across 10 categories: execution, phases 1-4, examples, statistics, performance, edge cases, completeness
- All tests pass: unit tests, integration tests, data validation, sample tests, performance tests
- Test execution: 1.73 seconds, validates pipeline outputs correctly
- Identified data quirks: BCE dates for ancient figures, birth/death date handling
- Created preprocessing/README.md with complete documentation

**Session 4 - Frontend Implementation (Day 3)**

- Created knowledge/decisions.md with ADR-001 for map library selection
- Comprehensive comparison: Leaflet.js vs MapLibre GL JS vs OpenLayers
- Analysis of Phase 2/3 requirements (brushing, linking, animations, heatmap)
- Decision criteria: bundle size, open-source, DH adoption, Phase 2+ feasibility
- Recommendation: MapLibre GL JS for WebGL rendering and advanced features
- Trade-offs documented: 220 KB bundle (vs 40 KB Leaflet), steeper learning curve
- Rationale: Phase 2 brushing/linking easier with WebGL, native heatmap, future-proof
- Commits: f579aba (JOURNAL.md move), 5290160 (ADR document, 201 lines)

**Session 5 - MapLibre MVP Implementation**
- Analyzed complete project structure: data pipeline complete, frontend at 10%
- Created comprehensive step-by-step analysis: 6 phases covering documentation, code, tests, status
- Key findings: 3,617 women extracted, 808 matched to CMIF, 1,042 with geodata (28.8%)
- Identified gap: map rendering not implemented, only data validation
- Made decision: MapLibre GL JS over Leaflet for WebGL rendering and Phase 2 foundation
- Replaced Leaflet CDN references with MapLibre GL JS 4.7.1 in index.html
- Implemented complete map initialization with OpenStreetMap raster tiles
- Built GeoJSON conversion from persons.json (1,042 features with geodata)
- Added clustering: clusterMaxZoom=14, clusterRadius=50, step-based sizing
- Implemented three-layer rendering: clusters, cluster counts, individual markers
- Applied data-driven styling with role-based colors (sender/mentioned/both/indirect)
- Added zoom-based marker sizing (4px at z5, 12px at z15)
- Implemented click handlers: zoom on clusters, popups on markers
- Built popup templates with person data, badges (GND/SNDB), stats, location
- Connected filter system: role and normierung checkboxes update map in real-time
- Implemented tab switching with map resize on Karte tab activation
- Added loading states, error handling, stats display in navbar
- Updated CSS for MapLibre popup styling (removed Leaflet-specific styles)
- Finalized ADR-001: MapLibre GL JS accepted with implementation details
- Updated docs/README.md with local testing instructions and tech stack
- Total implementation: 419 lines JavaScript, fully functional MVP
- Commit: e75156a (4 files, 480 insertions, 58 deletions)

**Technical Details:**
- Map center: Weimar (11.3235, 50.9795) at zoom 5
- Navigation controls added (top-right)
- Cursor changes on hover (pointer for clusters and markers)
- Filter logic: roleMatch checks person.roles array and person.role field
- Layer management: remove existing layers/sources before re-rendering
- Performance: instant filter updates via layer re-rendering (no map reload)

**ADR-001 Final Decision:**
- MapLibre GL JS chosen for superior WebGL performance
- 220 KB bundle size acceptable (negligible vs 1.5 MB data)
- Native clustering with smooth transitions
- Data-driven styling cleaner than custom icons
- Better foundation for Phase 2 brushing and linking
- Trade-offs: larger bundle, WebGL requirement (acceptable for modern browsers)

**Bugfixes (Session 5 continued):**
- Fixed glyphs error: added glyphs property to map style for text rendering
- Fixed font 404 error: changed text-font from 'Open Sans Semibold' to 'Noto Sans Regular'
- Result: cluster count labels render correctly without console errors
- Commits: 97a2869 (glyphs fix), c2860bd (font fix)
- Map fully functional: 1,042 markers, clustering working, filters active, zero errors

**Session 6 - Clustering Improvements and Multi-Person Popup Implementation**
- Updated README.md with live GitHub Pages deployment link
- Marked GitHub Pages deployment as complete in project status
- Updated citation with author name and live URL
- Fixed JOURNAL.md path reference (moved to documentation/ folder)

**Clustering Optimization (Commit: 734908d):**
- Reduced clusterMaxZoom from 14 to 10 (clusters break apart earlier)
- Reduced clusterRadius from 50 to 40 (less aggressive clustering)
- Increased marker sizes: zoom 5 (4px→6px), zoom 10 (8px→10px), zoom 15 (12px→16px)
- Rationale: Users reported difficulty seeing individual entries at city level
- Result: Individual markers now visible at zoom 10 (city/neighborhood level)

**Multi-Person Popup Implementation (ADR-002, Commit: 9014a40):**
- Problem identified: 217 women in Weimar share identical coordinates (121 in Berlin, 61 in Frankfurt)
- Users could only click topmost marker, missing 99% of entries at same location
- Critical usability issue preventing data discovery

**Solution: Multi-person popup with location grouping**
- Modified click handler to use queryRenderedFeatures() for all markers at point
- Single marker: shows single-person popup (unchanged behavior)
- Multiple markers: shows scrollable list of all people at location
- Displays first 15 entries with "Zeige alle X Frauen" button for expansion
- Each entry shows: name, dates, GND/SNDB badges, letter/mention stats

**Technical Implementation:**
- Created showMultiPersonPopup() function for locations with 2+ people
- Renamed showPopup() to showSinglePersonPopup() for clarity
- Added expandPersonList() function for "Show all" button functionality
- Stores features in map._currentPopupFeatures for expansion
- Popup maxWidth: 400px, scrollable list max-height: 400px

**CSS Styling:**
- Multi-person popup container with responsive padding
- Person list with custom scrollbar (6px width, rounded)
- Person items with hover effects (background color transition)
- Show-more button with academic color scheme (steel blue)
- Mobile-friendly scrollable design

**Architecture Decision Record (ADR-002):**
- Documented in knowledge/decisions.md (212 lines)
- Analyzed 4 alternatives: spiderfy plugin, multi-person popup, coordinate jittering, increased clustering
- Decision: Multi-person popup for better UX, mobile-friendliness, no dependencies
- Trade-off: Deviates from original "Spiderfier" spec in requirements.md
- Rationale: Better for target audience (general public), historical data characteristics (city-level coordinates), academic context
- Future consideration: Can add spiderfy later if user testing shows need

**Testing Results:**
- Weimar popup: Shows "217 Frauen • Wirkungsort" with scrollable list
- Berlin popup: Shows "121 Frauen"
- Frankfurt popup: Shows "61 Frauen"
- Single markers work correctly with original popup
- Scroll and expand functionality smooth
- Performance: queryRenderedFeatures() fast, popup rendering instant

**Key Commits:**
- 734908d: Clustering improvements and README updates
- 9014a40: Multi-person popup implementation with ADR-002

**Session 7 - Person Detail Pages Implementation (Phase 2)**
- Implemented complete person detail page system with 6-tab structure
- URL-based routing: person.html?id=[SNDB-ID]
- Responsive design matching academic color scheme

**New Files Created:**

# Session 8: Cluster Click Fix and Debugging System

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Focus:** Fix cluster clicks not working, implement debugging system

## Problem Identified

User reported clicking on cluster circles (e.g., "14 Frauen", "218 Frauen") did nothing. Investigation revealed multiple issues:

1. Tooltip variable scope issue (clusterTooltip defined inside mouseenter handler)
2. Event handlers registered multiple times on filter changes
3. MapLibre getClusterLeaves() callback never executed

## Initial Fixes Attempted

**Fix 1: Tooltip Variable Scope (Commit 733b590)**
- Moved clusterTooltip and markerTooltip to renderMarkers function scope
- Click handler could now access and remove hover tooltips
- Problem: Still not working, handlers firing multiple times

**Fix 2: Tooltip Text Truncation (Commit 47f7fd2)**
- Added max-width: 250px and text-overflow: ellipsis
- Fixed long names like "Maria Theresia Antonina Josephine Tys..." overflowing
- CSS improvements for hover tooltips

## Debugging System Implementation

**Compact Logging Utility (Commit 3352958)**

Added color-coded console logging system:

```javascript
const log = {
    init: (msg) => console.log(`🟢 INIT: ${msg}`),
    render: (msg) => console.log(`🔵 RENDER: ${msg}`),
    event: (msg) => console.log(`🟡 EVENT: ${msg}`),
    click: (msg) => console.log(`🟠 CLICK: ${msg}`),
    error: (msg) => console.error(`🔴 ERROR: ${msg}`)
};
```

Logging added to:
- Application initialization and data loading
- renderMarkers (initial vs setData updates)
- Layer and event handler setup
- Cluster and marker click events with details
- Filter application

**Debug findings from browser console:**
- Click handler fired multiple times (2-4×) per click
- getClusterLeaves callback never executed (no "Callback executed" log)
- Confirmed MapLibre getClusterLeaves API incompatibility

## Architecture Refactoring

**Data-Driven Rendering (Commits c6a6323, final fix)**

Problem: renderMarkers() recreated layers and re-registered event handlers on every call

Solution implemented:

1. **Source Updates via setData():**
```javascript
if (map.getSource('persons')) {
    map.getSource('persons').setData(geojson); // Update data only
} else {
    map.addSource('persons', {...}); // Create source first time
}
```

2. **Separate Layer Creation:**
```javascript
function addMapLayers() {
    // Create cluster, label, and marker layers once
}
```

3. **Single Event Handler Registration:**
```javascript
let handlersSetup = false;

if (!handlersSetup) {
    setupEventHandlers();
    handlersSetup = true;
}
```

4. **Direct Data Filtering Instead of getClusterLeaves:**

MapLibre's getClusterLeaves() callback never executed. Solution: Filter persons directly from data:

```javascript
const personsAtLocation = filteredPersons.filter(person => {
    const place = person.places[0];
    const distance = Math.sqrt(
        Math.pow(place.lon - clusterCoords[0], 2) +
        Math.pow(place.lat - clusterCoords[1], 2)
    );
    return distance < 0.001; // ~100m radius
});
```

Convert to feature format and show popup:
```javascript
const features = personsAtLocation.map(person => ({
    properties: { id, name, role, gnd, dates, letter_count, ... }
}));
showMultiPersonPopup(lngLat, features);
```

## Final Behavior

**Cluster Click (≤50 persons):**
- Click cluster → filter persons by location from data
- Show multi-person popup with all persons at location
- Scrollable list, "Show all" button for >15 entries
- Each entry clickable → person detail page

**Cluster Click (>50 persons):**
- Click cluster → zoom in by 2 levels
- Cluster breaks apart into smaller clusters or individual markers

**Hover Tooltips:**
- Cluster: "X Frauen" (with ellipsis truncation for UI)
- Individual marker: "Name (birth–death)"
- Removed on click or mouseleave

## Console Log Output (Working)

```
🟢 INIT: Starting application
🟢 INIT: Loaded 3617 persons, 1042 with geodata
🟢 INIT: Application ready
🔵 RENDER: Creating source: 1042 markers (initial)
🔵 RENDER: Adding layers (first time)
🔵 RENDER: Setting up event handlers (first time)
🟡 EVENT: Registering event handlers
🟠 CLICK: Cluster clicked - processing...
🟠 CLICK: Cluster: 12 persons at [6.9585, 51.0414]
🟠 CLICK: Finding persons at cluster location from data (≤50 threshold)
🟠 CLICK: Found 12 persons at cluster location
```

Popup shows all 12 persons successfully.

## Technical Decisions

**Why not use getClusterLeaves?**
- MapLibre's geojson source getClusterLeaves callback never executed
- Likely requires Supercluster direct access (not available in MapLibre API)
- Direct data filtering more reliable and transparent

**Why separate handlersSetup flag?**
- Event handlers persist across layer updates
- Flag prevents duplicate registration on filter changes
- Cleaner than map.off() approach (no function references needed)

**Why 0.001° radius for location matching?**
- ~100m accuracy matches typical geocoding precision
- Accounts for slight coordinate variations in source data
- Small enough to avoid false positives

## Files Changed

- [docs/js/app.js](../docs/js/app.js): Refactored rendering, added logging, fixed cluster clicks
- [docs/css/style.css](../docs/css/style.css): Tooltip text truncation
- documentation/JOURNAL.md: This session documentation

## Key Commits

- 733b590: Fix tooltip variable scope
- 47f7fd2: Tooltip text truncation
- 3352958: Compact logging system
- c6a6323: Enhanced callback logging
- 4cc66f3: Data-driven rendering with direct person filtering

# Session 9: Research Interface Improvements - Filters and Visual Hierarchy

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Focus:** Transform technical interface into research-oriented tool with clear visual hierarchy

## Problem Analysis

User feedback: "Es soll ja ein Forschungsinterface sein"

**Issues identified:**

1. **All clusters looked identical** - no visual hierarchy or meaning
   - All blue regardless of content
   - No way to distinguish "writing hotspots" from "mention locations"
   - Research question "Where were women writing?" impossible to answer visually

2. **Technical filter labels**
   - "Rolle" unclear
   - "Normierung (GND/SNDB)" not research-relevant
   - Missing occupation-based filtering

3. **No legend** - color meanings invisible
   - User asked: "warum sind ein paar grün und warum ein paar grau?"
   - No way to interpret cluster colors
   - Missing documentation of visual encoding

## Data Analysis for Filter Design

**Role distribution (3,617 women):**
- 77.7% indirect (2,809) - only in SNDB, no letters
- 17.0% mentioned (616) - mentioned in letters
- 4.3% both (156) - mentioned AND sender
- 1.0% sender (36) - only as sender

**Occupation data:**
- 979 persons with occupations (27.1%)
- 231 unique occupation types
- Top occupations: Schauspielerin (222), Schriftstellerin (199), Sängerin (142)

**Key insight:** Only 192 women (5.3%) wrote letters, but these are most research-relevant.

## Solution: Research-Oriented Filters

### 1. Renamed Filter: Briefaktivität

**Before (technical):**
```
Rolle
☑ Absenderin
☑ Erwähnt
☐ Indirekt (SNDB)
```

**After (research-focused):**
```
Briefaktivität
☑ Hat geschrieben (sender + both = 192 women)
☑ Wurde erwähnt (mentioned + both = 772 women)
☐ Nur SNDB-Eintrag (indirect = 2,809 women)
```

**Rationale:**
- "Hat geschrieben" clearer than "Absenderin"
- Focus on action rather than role
- "Nur SNDB-Eintrag" explains what "indirect" means

### 2. Removed Filter: Normierung

**Deleted:**
```
Normierung
☑ GND vorhanden (34.1%)
☑ Nur SNDB
```

**Rationale:**
- Technical metadata, not research question
- GND presence doesn't affect interpretation
- Simplified interface

### 3. New Filter: Berufsgruppe

**7 occupation groups based on data analysis:**

```javascript
const OCCUPATION_GROUPS = {
    'artistic': ['Schauspielerin', 'Malerin', 'Tänzerin', 'Stempelschneiderin', ...],
    'literary': ['Schriftstellerin', 'Übersetzerin', 'Dichterin'],
    'musical': ['Sängerin', 'Pianistin', 'Komponistin', ...],
    'court': ['Hofdame', 'Oberhofmeisterin', 'Prinzessin', ...],
    'education': ['Erzieherin', 'Pädagogin', 'Lehrerin']
};
```

**Filter UI:**
```
Berufsgruppe
☑ Künstlerisch (~440 women)
☑ Literarisch (~226 women)
☑ Musikalisch (~183 women)
☑ Hof/Adel (~100 women)
☑ Bildung (~45 women)
☑ Sonstiges
☑ Kein Beruf angegeben (2,638 women)
```

**Research questions enabled:**
- Where were artistic women concentrated?
- How do literary vs. court women differ geographically?
- Which cities had educational roles for women?

## Solution: Visual Hierarchy with Cluster Colors

### MapLibre Cluster Properties

Aggregate role counts within each cluster:

```javascript
clusterProperties: {
    'sender_count': ['+', ['case', ['==', ['get', 'role'], 'sender'], 1, 0]],
    'mentioned_count': ['+', ['case', ['==', ['get', 'role'], 'mentioned'], 1, 0]],
    'both_count': ['+', ['case', ['==', ['get', 'role'], 'both'], 1, 0]],
    'indirect_count': ['+', ['case', ['==', ['get', 'role'], 'indirect'], 1, 0]]
}
```

### Data-Driven Color Expression

```javascript
'circle-color': [
    'case',
    // >50% wrote letters (sender + both) → Steel Blue
    ['>', ['+', ['get', 'sender_count'], ['get', 'both_count']],
          ['*', ['get', 'point_count'], 0.5]], '#2c5f8d',

    // >50% only mentioned → Medium Gray
    ['>', ['get', 'mentioned_count'], ['*', ['get', 'point_count'], 0.5]], '#6c757d',

    // >50% only SNDB entries → Light Gray
    ['>', ['get', 'indirect_count'], ['*', ['get', 'point_count'], 0.5]], '#adb5bd',

    // Mixed (no majority) → Forest Green
    '#2d6a4f'
]
```

### Color Meanings

- 🔵 **Steel Blue (#2c5f8d):** >50% wrote letters - "writing hotspots"
- 🟢 **Forest Green (#2d6a4f):** Mixed composition - diverse locations
- 🔘 **Medium Gray (#6c757d):** >50% only mentioned - "passive presence"
- ⚪ **Light Gray (#adb5bd):** >50% only SNDB - no letter connection

**50% threshold rationale:**
- Clear majority = dominant characteristic
- Avoids ambiguity
- Simple mental model

## Solution: Map Legend

**HTML structure:**
```html
<div class="map-legend">
    <h4>Cluster-Farben</h4>
    <div class="legend-item">
        <span class="legend-color" style="background: #2c5f8d;"></span>
        <span>Überwiegend geschrieben (>50%)</span>
    </div>
    <!-- 3 more items -->
</div>
```

**CSS positioning:**
- Bottom-right corner (standard cartographic convention)
- White background with shadow for readability
- z-index: 10 (above map, below controls)
- Responsive sizing for mobile

**Benefits:**
- Always visible during interaction
- Self-documenting interface
- Enables proper interpretation
- Reduces cognitive load

## Enhanced Hover Tooltips

**Before:**
```
111 Frauen
```

**After:**
```
111 Frauen
45 geschrieben • 58 erwähnt • 8 SNDB
```

**Implementation:**
```javascript
const senderCount = (props.sender_count || 0) + (props.both_count || 0);
const mentionedCount = (props.mentioned_count || 0) + (props.both_count || 0);
const indirectCount = props.indirect_count || 0;

let details = [];
if (senderCount > 0) details.push(`${senderCount} geschrieben`);
if (mentionedCount > 0) details.push(`${mentionedCount} erwähnt`);
if (indirectCount > 0) details.push(`${indirectCount} SNDB`);
```

**Progressive disclosure:**
- Summary on hover (no click required)
- Full list on click
- Details on demand in person pages

## Research Value

**Spatial patterns now visible:**
1. **Writing centers:** Blue clusters show where women actively corresponded
2. **Mention networks:** Gray clusters show where women were talked about
3. **Mixed communities:** Green clusters show diverse engagement
4. **Occupation geography:** Filter reveals artistic/literary/court concentrations

**Example research workflows:**

```
Q: Where were Schriftstellerinnen (writers) active?
A: Filter → Literarisch → See blue clusters in Berlin, Weimar, Leipzig
```

```
Q: Where were women only mentioned, not writing?
A: Look for gray clusters → Court cities, smaller towns
```

```
Q: Which cities had diverse women's engagement?
A: Green clusters → Mixed writing/mention activity
```

## Technical Implementation

**Files changed:**
- docs/index.html: Filter HTML, legend structure
- docs/js/app.js: Occupation groups, cluster properties, color logic, tooltip content
- docs/css/style.css: Legend styling, responsive design

**Key functions:**
- `getOccupationGroup(person)`: Classify occupation into 7 groups
- `OCCUPATION_GROUPS`: Mapping of occupations to categories
- Cluster properties in MapLibre source
- Data-driven paint expression for circle-color

**Performance:**
- Occupation classification: O(n) on data load, cached
- Cluster color calculation: GPU-accelerated (MapLibre expression)
- No performance impact from additional filters

## User Feedback Integration

**Original request:** "dass muss klarer sein und wo als legende sichtbar sein!"

**Response:**
